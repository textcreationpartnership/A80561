         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Worthy Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>TO give you the prrticulars of the ſtate of the army, ſince my laſt, it is briefly thus; that the King is ſtill at Sir <hi>John Cuts</hi> his houſe, where is the Lord <hi>Mountague,</hi> and the reſt of the Commiſſioners for the Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who diſpoſe of things there, as they
<pb facs="tcp:160272:4"/>did at <hi>Holdenby</hi> about his Majeſty, Mr. <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> is Chamberlain to the King, and the reſt of the attendants appointed by the Houſes, are with his Majeſty in their ſeverall places as they all acted at <hi>Holmby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Generals Excellency hath been view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ground for a generall Randezvouze, and the Regiments came up laſt night all near this place, and are drawn to their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Randezvouze according to the order of the houſes.</p>
            <p>I find the Souldiers to have many things to preſent this day, thoſe which are moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall amongſt the Regiments, are theſe which I have ſent you here incloſed.</p>
            <p>The Kings Majeſty hath no deſire to goe back to <hi>Holmby,</hi> but either (ſo far as I can learn) to go to <hi>London,</hi> or be hereabouts: His Majeſty hath had ſome diſcourſe about In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependants (as ſome call them) &amp; ſome que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were made what they would have, or whether they would have any government, which his Majeſty thought they would not have admitted of: the King is very pleaſant and merry, and ſometimes walks, other times
<pb facs="tcp:160272:4"/>his Majeſty rides forth with the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, but the Guard are very vigilant about him.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſioners are come from the Parliament, two Lords, and four Commoners who are going to communicate their Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to the army at a generall Randezvouze, for their receivin whereof, the ſouldiers are in great expectation.</p>
            <p>But before their meeting, the Generall called a Councell of warre, and the Officers received Inſtructions, for the more orderly carriage of the buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſioners are received with much reſpect and honour, and I perceive a great reſpect had towards them. God grant, that ſuch a compoſure may be made, as may ſettle this poore diſtracted Kingdome in peace.</p>
            <p>There was a flying report hare, that ſome of the Scots ſhould offer to ſend aſſiſtance into <hi>England,</hi> and that ſome of the City of <hi>London</hi> ſhould move for raiſing of new For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But anſwer was made, that the Common Councell refuſed to meddle in any ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:160272:5"/>thing, and that they only took care for ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the City of <hi>London,</hi> againſt Malignants and diſ-affected perſons, and that there was no feare of any forces from <hi>Scotland</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage with us, and that theſr things was only raiſed to diſtract us the more, not that it is really ſo. I hope this day will produce a right underſtanding both between the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and the Army; and alſo betweene the King and both. The ſouldiers, as <hi>I</hi> here, have ſome papers this day, which the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers have not ſeen, which ſome ſay they will preſent, or not as they ſhall ſee cauſe. We are all now very buſie upon this great work of the day, God grant a good iſſue. Sir, <hi>I</hi> pray excuſe the haſt of your ſervant,</p>
